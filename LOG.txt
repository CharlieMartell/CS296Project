Work Log:

11/24/14:

Begun working on Application "HomeSafe".
Quickly finding this application is not a good demonstration of ndk or synchronization.
Brainstorming other ideas think I will made sudokusolver as I can use pthreads.

11/28/14:

Created SudokuSolver application, setup all java files now I just need to write c to actually solve.

12/2/14:

Working on C code encountering some errors with jni.h. As of now application layout is done and
front end is working as intended however, backend is having issues parsing JStrings to char*.

12/4/14: 

Still working on issue, chaging scope of project again to SudokuChecker as Solver is finnicky,
because initializing arrays in native c which is how I setup to declare a board can be strange as 
I have to parse Jstrings into ints and if there isnt anything there on the board it was giving me many errors.

12/5/14:

Wrote all of backend C code to check if a 81 character string is considered a valid sudoku board.

12/7/14:

Still many problems with Eclipse and NDK not sure how to figure it out, eclipse seems to find jni.h
but is unable to find any of the methods included in it :\

12/8/14:

Found some workarounds using android studio to do this part and build it was very hacky...
