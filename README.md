CS296-Project

This is my CS296-41 Project, it is an android application that uses Android NDK to check if a Sudoku Board is valid in native C.

My Project Video can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrKMaZBtRBA

My Project Log can be found at https://github.com/CharlieMartell/CS296Project/blob/master/LOG.txt

Some things to note: This is my android project built in eclipse and it was encoutering errors with finding jni.h so I remade it in Android Studio as I was unable to fix a bug with NDK and Eclipse.
